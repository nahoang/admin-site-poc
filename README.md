This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  
### Preparation

* Server side: 
	- Open Terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/Scout24-CH/frontend-challenge` 
	- Run  `npm i`
	- Then `npm start` 
	- Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and see the message.
	
* Frontend side: make sure the server's code is running first.
	- Run `yarn install`
	- `Yarn start` 
	- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and see the test

### ASSUMPTION

* This test do not required the responsive design. So I use the fixed dimension 1366px*768px
	
* Due to the repository of server side is too old for beginning. So I make the new repository for frontend side by using the command `create-react-app hello-world`

### ISSUES
* Can not make the **DELETE** request due to the error `405`.   Time is short, ignore it.
